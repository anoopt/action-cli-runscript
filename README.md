# action-cli-runscript
GitHub action to run a script using the Office 365 CLI

![Office 365 CLI Runscript](./images/cli-runscript.png)

This GitHub Action (created using typescript) uses [Office 365 CLI](https://pnp.github.io/office365-cli/), to run a line of script supplied to it or run code in a script file supplied to it.

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in `.github/workflows` directory of your repo. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---office-365-cli-runscript) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Note
This action is dependant on `action-cli-login`. So in the workflow we need to run  `action-cli-login` before using this action.

#### Optional requirement
Since `action-cli-login` requires user name and password which are sensitive pieces of information, it would be ideal to store them securely. We can achieve this in a GitHub repo by using [secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). So, click on `settings` tab in your repo and add 2 new secrets:
- `adminUsername` - store the admin user name in this (e.g. user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com)
- `adminPassword` - store the password of that user in this.
These secrets are encrypted and can only be used by GitHub actions.

### Inputs
- `O365_CLI_SCRIPT` : The script to run
- `O365_CLI_SCRIPT_PATH` : Relative path of the script in your repo.
- `IS_POWERSHELL` : `true|false` Used only with O365_CLI_SCRIPT. Default is true. If false the assumption is the script will be shell script i.e. .sh.

One of `O365_CLI_SCRIPT_PATH` / `O365_CLI_SCRIPT` is mandatory, in case both are defined `O365_CLI_SCRIPT_PATH` gets preference.

### Example workflow - Office 365 CLI Runscript
On every `push` build the code, then deploy and then send an email using Office 365 CLI Runscript action.

```yaml
